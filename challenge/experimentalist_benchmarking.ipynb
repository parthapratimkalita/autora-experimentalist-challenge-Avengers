        "1. Sample 10 initial data points\n",

        "\n",

        "3. Pick a single novel data point using your experimentalist method. Your method may or may not take into account any of the theorists' models.\n",

        "5. Fit all theorists to the experiment data\n",

        "\n",
        "- Teams will be ranked based on the final fit to a ground-truth model. Observations will be sampled across the entire domain of the ground-truth model. The rank will be accumulated across all benchmarking challenges. The team with the best accumulated rank will win a prize at the end of the workshop.\n",
        "- The teams must provide a **brief presentation** (less than 5 minutes) of their experimentalist just before the final evaluation. You may use [this template for your slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qCKqH9uXkQmGqDmROh1Jn4UcauALkMRhqlbAHubns2Q/edit?usp=sharing).\n",
